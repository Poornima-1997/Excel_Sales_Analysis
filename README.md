Conclusion
The sales analysis shows total revenue of ₹35.2 Lakhs from 1000 orders, with an average spend of ₹3,520 per customer. Colors, Soft Toys, and Sweets emerged as top revenue categories, while Anniversary and Diwali occasions drove the highest sales. Peak revenues were observed in February and September, indicating strong seasonal demand. To grow further, the business should focus on festive marketing, improving delivery times, and expanding reach in underperforming cities.
